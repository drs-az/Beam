# üîê HexaShift (PWA)

**HexaShift** is a lightweight, offline encryption tool built for **privacy, simplicity, and control**. Designed as a standalone Progressive Web App (PWA), it enables peer-to-peer message and file encryption using high-entropy passphrases ‚Äî with **no servers**, **no accounts**, and **no data collection**. Once loaded, HexaShift works entirely offline.

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy-First Philosophy

Unlike legal-grade or enterprise tools that prioritize auditability and compliance, HexaShift embraces:

- **Anonymity over accountability**
- **Simplicity over bureaucracy**
- **Self-custody over cloud control**

No logs. No identities. No dependencies.  
**You** ‚Äî and only you ‚Äî control access to your encrypted messages and files.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AES-256-GCM** encryption via the WebCrypto API
- **PBKDF2** key derivation (150k iterations, SHA-256)
- Custom passphrase input with a strength meter powered by **zxcvbn**
- Encrypt and decrypt text, images, and encrypted text files
- **Image Encryption** with MIME type preservation and auto-download of decrypted files  
  _Note: Only images up to 100kb are supported. Larger images will trigger an error message._
- Generate and download a **QR code** of the encrypted message or file (when output is within length limits)
- Upload and decode QR codes for decryption
- Share encrypted messages via URL (with auto-decrypt preload)
- **Reset** button to clear fields and state
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Fully offline, installable PWA experience on Android and desktop

## üîê Passphrase Guidelines

You may use either:
- Numeric sequences with commas (e.g. `4,2,5,8,3,3`)
- Full alphanumeric passphrases (e.g. `correct horse battery staple`)

> üí° Commas are only required for numeric sequences.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (mobile or desktop).
2. Select one of the actions from the dropdown:
   - **Encrypt Text**
   - **Decrypt Text**
   - **Decrypt Text File**
   - **Encrypt Image**
   - **Decrypt QR**
3. For encryption, enter your message or upload an image (ensure the image is **100kb or smaller**); for decryption, paste the encrypted string, upload an encrypted text file, or scan/upload a QR code image.
4. Enter your passphrase.
5. Click the corresponding action button:
   - **Run** for text encryption/decryption
   - **Encrypt Image** for image encryption
   - **Decode QR** for QR code decryption
6. Review the result: copy the output, download the QR code, or share via the generated link.
7. Use the **Reset** button to clear the form and start over.

## üñºÔ∏è File and Image Encryption

- **Text File Decryption:** In addition to direct text input, you can upload an encrypted text file and have it decrypted automatically.
- **Image Encryption:** Upload an image file (PNG, JPG, etc.) to encrypt. The app embeds the file‚Äôs MIME type to ensure that when decrypted, the file downloads in its original format.
  - **File Size Limit:** Images must be **100kb or smaller**. If an image exceeds this size, an error message will be displayed in the result field.

## üîó URL-Based Sharing

When encrypting text or files, you can generate a shareable link. Anyone with this link and the correct passphrase can decrypt the message.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security & Connectivity Notes

- All encryption is performed **client-side** ‚Äî your passphrase is never stored or transmitted.
- **Offline Functionality:** All dependencies (zxcvbn, qrcode, jsQR) are bundled in the `libs/` folder. A service worker caches app files after the first visit, so HexaShift works offline.
- Choose a strong, unique passphrase to maximize security.
- The app **does not support forward secrecy** or digital signatures.
- Designed for **anonymity and plausible deniability**, not for audit logs or compliance.

## üß™ Use Cases

- Private, secure one-off communications
- Offline file exchanges (QR-to-QR or encrypted links)
- Scenarios requiring total local control
- Privacy-conscious users avoiding centralized platforms

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è in üåµ for the privacy-minded.  
**Own your encryption. Share nothing else.**
